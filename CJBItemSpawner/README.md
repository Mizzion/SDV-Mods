## FAQs
### What are 'problematic items'?
You can [edit `config.json`](#configure) to enable problematic items, which are normally hidden
because they cause in-game issues, glitches, or crashes. These are the items considered problematic:

item | issue
---- | -----
Crystal Chair | (Unreleased version.) Glitches and causes crashes once rotated / picked up.
Incubator | Can't be removed once placed.
Locked Door | Can't be removed once placed.
Mushroom Box | Can't be removed once placed (unless you install the [Moveable Mushroom Boxes](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2852) mod _before_ spawning them).
Obelisk | Once placed, it runs a glitched animation when the player is near that eventually starts switching between the Obelisk and a chicken statue sprite. Picking it up after that point can cause an immediate game crash or result in an unremovable inventory item.
Wicked Statue | (Lit eyes version.) Can't be removed once placed.
Jukebox Ring | Crashes the game when you enter the mines.
